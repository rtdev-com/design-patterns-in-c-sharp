# Chapter 1

## Strategy Pattern
Family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
Let's the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Design Principles:
* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same (p9)
* Program to an interface, not an implementation (p 11)
* Favor composition over inheritance (p 23)

## Program Output:
```
Quack
I'm flying!!
I can't fly
I'm flying with a rocket!
```
